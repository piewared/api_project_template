"""Consolidated authentication system tests.

This module combines and consolidates tests for:
- JWT service (claim extraction, JWKS fetching, JWT verification)
- OIDC client service (token exchange, user claims, PKCE flow)
- Session service (auth sessions, user sessions, JIT provisioning)
- BFF authentication router (login initiation, callback handling, /me endpoint)
- Authentication dependencies (require_scope, require_role authorization)

Replaces:
- tests/unit/core/test_services.py (JWT service functionality)
- tests/unit/core/test_oidc_client_service.py
- tests/unit/core/test_session_service.py
- tests/unit/api/test_auth_bff_router.py (partially)
- tests/unit/infrastructure/test_deps.py (authentication dependencies)
- Various other auth-related tests
